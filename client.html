	<p class="text-left" >There are several organizations which provide the facility of raising complaints, in which each of the organizations differ from each other in their type of complaint. These organizations define the type of services related to the complaint provided by them for customers. So, we can say that the definition of type of complaint differ as the services provided by various organizations are different. The meaning of customer complaint is nothing but the customer dissatisfaction and this is also considered as the form of market feedback.On the other hand, customer’s complaint management is considered the key role for organization’s success. The complaint management system acts as the survey for the customer’s feedback about the organization.
